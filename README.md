# Application Process

# Step 1 - MySQL Database
I installed MySQL and proceeded to scripted two tables. The first table is the User table which captures the First Name, Last Name and Date of Birth of the User.
The second table captures the financial data of the user. 

# Step 2 - HTML
 
In my solution there are two html files. The home.html file sets up the home page where a user inputs their First Name, Last Name and Date of Birth.
The index.html file is where the user will upload their financial data.

# Step 3 - Python

 ## db_connection.py 

  In this python file a connection is made to the database. Usually I would store any credentials in an Azure Key Vault and reference this in my code for security reasons.
